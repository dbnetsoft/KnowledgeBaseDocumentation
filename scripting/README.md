# Scripting

Some software products come with a powerful scripting engine called [Scriban](https://github.com/scriban/scriban).

At the developer's website, you'll find an extensive documentation about the [language ](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md)and [built-in functions](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/builtins.md).&#x20;
