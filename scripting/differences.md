# Differences



## Casing

Different than stated in the scriban docs, scripts used in dbnetsoft software products do not change the casing of variables or functions. Even more, you can use `string.ends_with`or `string.EndsWith`, whereas the later is preferred as it means the declaration of the method is not touched.
