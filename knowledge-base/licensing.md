# Licensing

For the most part, our licenses are time-limited licenses, e.g. one year. After that period, the license will not work anymore.&#x20;

All our software can be used without a license in demo mode. This mode let you try out all the features, but the software will close itself after a couple of minutes without prior notice.&#x20;

## License Types

* License File\
  These _\*.lic_ files need to be copied into the program directory, usually `c:\program files\dbnetsoft\<productname>`
* USB-Dongles\
  These special dongles need to be attached to the computer during operation
* Online Activation\
  A key code must be entered on a single computer and then renders this computer activate - no more than one computer can be activated at a single time

## Checking license

Licensing works very similar across all our software products. You can check the state of the license quickly at the top right corner:&#x20;

Green means licensed, orange means demo mode or license error. More information can be obtained when clicking on the licensing button.&#x20;

The license information windows will show you all the relevant licneses available and installed:&#x20;

## Online Activation

Click on the licensing button in the top right corner - this will bring up the License Information window. In the section _Online Activation_, enter your license code and click _Activate_ button.&#x20;

For the activation to work, the computer needs to be connected to the internet. After activation, it will remain activated for 7 days. Only after that, the system needs to be online again to renew activation.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you expect to have no internet connection at the event, make sure to activate the computer shortly before leaving for the event. This way you have 7 days without the need to re-activate.&#x20;
